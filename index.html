            <p>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie was an American computer scientist. He is most well-known for creating the C
                programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system and B
                programming language. Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the
                Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in
                1999. Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in
                2007. He was the "R" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username dmr.

                    <h2>Early Days</h2>
                    <h3>September 9, 1941 (Born)</h3>
                    <p>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie was born to a middle-class family on September 9, 1941, in Bronxville,
                        New York. His father, Alistair, was a scientist at Bell Labs, the famous American scientific
                        research and development company known for its track record of innovation.From a young age, it
                        was clear that Dennis Ritchie had an intrinsic aptitude for science and math.He excelled in his
                        studies. Upon graduation from Summit High School in 1959, he packed his bags and moved north to
                        attend Harvard University.</p>

                    <h2>Higher Studies</h2>
                    <h3>October 14, 1998</h3>
                    <p>Ritchie attended Harvard University where he achieved an undergraduate degree in physics in 1963,
                        and a doctoral degree in applied mathematics in 1968. Dennis Ritchie had decided to study
                        physics. But a chance lecture he attended - on Harvard's computer system, the Univac I - changed
                        the course of his life.
                        At the time, computers were not widely understood and programming was not a degree.But Ritchie
                        was hooked.He took a job at a computer lab at the nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
                        where he sunk his teeth into the world of computers.His intellectual curiosity knew no
                        bounds.Ritchie dove headfirst into the new field, absorbing everything it had to offer.
                        By the time he graduated from Harvard with a degree in physics, Dennis Ritchie had decided that
                        he would spend his life working with computers.</p>

                    <h2>Joined Bell Labs</h2>
                    <h3>January 1, 1967</h3>
                    <p>In 1967, he joined Bell Labs to begin his life's work. Ritchie was paired with Ken Thompson, a
                        similarly young, ambitious programmer from UC Berkeley.From the start, it was clear that the two
                        were kindred spirits.They began work on operating system design - creating the systems that
                        manage a computer's basic functions.Ritchie and Thompson had observed that minicomputers were
                        the future, but believed a simpler operating system would be required to manage and streamline
                        interactions between multiple computers.To meet this future need, they started working on the
                        UNIX operating system.As the pair began building UNIX, they realized that the assembly language
                        (low-level programming language) they were using was too rigid for their use case.Dennis Ritchie
                        proposed creating a new, higher-level language.</p>

                    <p>This idea, and his creation, would change the world.</p>

                    <h2>Brith of the C Language</h2>
                    <h3>1969-1973</h3>
                    <p>Dennis Ritchie's new programming language - which he named "C" (it was based on Thompson's "B"
                        language) - gave the pair what they needed.They completed the UNIX build.Its unique structure
                        made possible a new level of portability not previously seen in operating systems.As with most
                        transformative innovations, it took time for the full impact of the C programming language and
                        the UNIX operating system to be felt.Interestingly, it was the open-source, non-controlling
                        approach to the new innovations that sparked their widespread adoption.In 1973, Dennis Ritchie
                        published a research paper on the C programming language.Several years later, he and a colleague
                        co-authored a book - The C Programming Language - which would become a Bible of sorts to young
                        programmers around the world.At the same time as C was spreading like wildfire around the
                        programming world, Bell Labs began giving away the UNIX source code.</p>
                    <p>
                        When the legendary technologists of the 1980s and 1990s began building the future, they were
                        building with C and UNIX.</p>

                <p>It's funny how fickle fame can be. One week Steve Jobs dies and his death tops the news agendas in
                    dozens
                    of countries. Just over a week later, Dennis Ritchie dies and nobody – except for a few geeks –
                    notices.
                    And yet his work touched the lives of far more people than anything Steve Jobs ever did. In fact if
                    you're reading this online then the chances are that the router which connects you to the internet
                    is
                    running a descendant of the software that Ritchie and his colleague Ken Thompson created in 1969.

                <p>Eleven years ago next month, we lost two industry giants. One of them would have been 80 years old
                    today.
                    It is undeniable that Steve Jobs brought us innovation and iconic products like the world had never
                    seen, as well as a cult following of consumers and end users that mythologized him. The younger
                    generation that reads this column is probably scratching their heads. Who was Dennis
                    Ritchie?</p>
                <p>Dennis Ritchie wasn't some meticulous billionaire wunderkind from Silicon Valley that mystified
                    audiences with standing-room-only presentations in his minimalist black mock turtleneck with new
                    shiny products and wild rhetoric aimed against his competitors.
                    No, Dennis Ritchie was a bearded, somewhat disheveled computer scientist who wore cardigan sweaters
                    and had a messy office.</p>
                <p>Unlike Jobs, a college dropout, he was a Ph.D., a Harvard University grad with physics and applied
                    mathematics degrees.
                    And instead of the gleaming Silicon Valley, he worked at AT&T Bell Laboratories in New Jersey.</p>
